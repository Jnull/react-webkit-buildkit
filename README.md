# Simple ReactJS Live-Server Webpack BuildKitGet started:* yarn install OR npm install (NodeJS Required)* npm run devHow it works: * [WebPack 2](https://webpack.github.io/) watches js files for change then rebuilds them to ./src/client.min.js * [Live-Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) hosts the ./src directy (index.html) port 8000 and reloads on file changeMore documentation: [Reactjs v4 Docs](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
